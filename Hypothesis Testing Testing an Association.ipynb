The data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis. The principal investigators responsible for data collection were:\n",

Use sns.boxplot() to plot side by side box plots of thalach for patients who were and were not diagnosed with heart disease (indicated by the heart_disease variable). Do you think there is a relationship between these variables?\n",

Now that you’ve gotten your feet wet, there are a number of additional variables in this dataset that we haven’t looked at yet! If you want additional practice, use this space to continue your investigation. What other variables might be predictive of heart disease?
